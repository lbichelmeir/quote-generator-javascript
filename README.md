# quote-generator-javascript
a random quote generator built with HTML/CSS/JavaScript


## Learning Outcomes [Why]
I wanted to further my vanilla javascript knowledge, so I decided to create a random quote generator! 

### Learning Outcomes
[] practice using an API
[] practice HTML & CSS styling

## What I learned
- Figuring out how to use the quotes API wasn't as hard as I thought it would be, so I thought I would challenge myself by trying to generate random background images using the **Unsplash API**
